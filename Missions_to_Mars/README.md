# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars


## Step 1 - Scraping

Completed initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Created a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and used this to complete all scraping and analysis tasks. 

### NASA Mars News

* Scraped the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assigned the text to variables that can reference later.

```python
# Example:
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visited the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

```python
# Example:
featured_image_url = 'https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA16225_hires.jpg'
```

### Mars Weather

* Visited the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scraped the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Save the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called `mars_weather`.

```python
# Example:
mars_weather = 'Sol 1801 (Aug 30, 2017), Sunny, high -21C/-5F, low -80C/-112F, pressure at 8.82 hPa, daylight 06:09-17:55'
```

### Mars Facts

* Visited the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visited the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Used MongoDB with Flask templating for creating a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Started by converting Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will executed all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, created a route called `/scrape` that  imported  `scrape_mars.py` script and called  `scrape` function.

  * Stored the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Created a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Created a template HTML file called `index.html` that takes the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.
